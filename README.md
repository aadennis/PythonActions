# PythonActions

A sandbox for Github Actions (GA), focussed on Python.  
My first task is to understand issues around test discovery in GA, using pytest.  
This is because tests that run fine locally are not being discovered in GA.  
I thought the culprit was PYTHONPATH or similar, but that seems not to be the problem.
